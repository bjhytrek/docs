#The MoFed Intern Starter Kit

Welcome to the team! As an intern on the CSP Front End team (we call ourselves MoFed, for Mormon Front End Developers), we want you to grow as much as possible and contribute as well. This starter kit will outline your first set of projects and will allow us to evaluate where you're at. It will also give you the opportunity to learn and to build out tools that will help the rest of the team.

Before starting here, you should have already gone through the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/teamMoFed/docs/blob/master/gettingStarted.md). Your computer and environments should be set up and ready to go. If that hasn't happened yet, start there.

##Project 1: DevTest
All employees of MoFed take our DevTest as part of the interview process. This allows us to evaluate their skill level and gives us insight into their coding style and experience level. We'd like you to take this test for those same reasons, but additionally to strengthen your front end dev skills.

The DevTest is located [here](https://github.com/teamMoFed/devtest). Please read through all of the instructions and follow the instructions for the 'Lead and Above' task level. This will give you maximum exposure to the type of work we do.

###Items to keep in mind while completing the DevTest:

* Understand the requirements. You are encouraged to ask questions. Start by doing some resarch on your own. If you're at all stumped or if you have question regarding process or methodology, such as "What are you looking for here?", ask coworkers and team leads for help at any time. You have great resources around you. Please utilize them.
* Our stack consists of Node.js, React, Redux and PostCSS. If you're new to React and Redux, you're not required to use them for this test. Use what you know but plan on diving into React and Redux in the near future.
* Use CSS Variables (native, not via preprocessor). Browser compatibility is not our focus for this test.
* Develop mobile first. You aren't provided with mobile designs but you're expected to develop mobile first. Welcome to CSP.
* Make your code as reusable as possible (Always think with a component mindset)
* Write in vanilla JS - no jQuery or other such libraries
* Leverage ES6+ as often as it makes sense

This is meant to be a challenging but fun experience. Try to have fun with it and see how much you can learn.
