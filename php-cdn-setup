git branching model
CDN
branch from master into feature/[[featureName]]
PR from your feature branch into dev/test/stage/master
after you merge into master, delete the feature branch
source/prototypes
branch from master into feature/[[featureName]] (should match CDN feature branch if doing CDN-specific changes)
PR from your feature branch into master once your equivalent CDN branch has made it to master
after you merge into master, delete the feature branch
https version of pages
This worked for me but did require a few minor tweaks as I was going through (we have a different path for file location, etc
